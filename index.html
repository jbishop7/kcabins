                Kincardine Cabin Retreat is hidden amongst giant cedar trees overlooking the shores of Lake Huron. The property is less than 3 minutes by foot away from downtown Kincardine, the Lighthouse, and pristine Blue Flag beaches. This rustic property has a prominent place in local history stemming from its roots as a tourist retreat from 1946 - 1970, when it was known as HILORCORT CABINS.
